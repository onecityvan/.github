# OneCity Vancouver

OneCity Vancouver is a progressive municipal political party and registered elector organization under the Local Elections Campaign Financing Act (LECFA) in British Columbia. We are committed to building a more inclusive, sustainable, and equitable city by organizing to elect candidates who share our vision. We advocate for policies that promote environemntal and social justice, public health and safety, and shared economic prosperity. Our vision includes affordable housing, walkable neighbourhoods with accessible public transit, and a green economy that benefits all residents.

## Our Current Work

- **Hold the Mayor Sim's ABC Government Accountable**: We strive to ensure transparency and accountability in local governance, challenging the policies that favour the city's richest and most powerful elites. 
- **Advance Progressive Policies**: We advocate for inclusive and equitable policies that address the needs of all Vancouver residents, focusing on issues like affordable housing, wasteful spending, public transportation, and climate action.
- **Elect a Unified Left Majority in 2026**: Our goal is to build a strong, unified progressive majority on the City Council to implement transformative policies for a better Vancouver.
